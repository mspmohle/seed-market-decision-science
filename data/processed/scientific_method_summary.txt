USDA Crop Yield Decision Science Study — Summary
============================================================

Date: October 29, 2025

1. Ask a Question
-----------------
How do regional (state-level) and temporal (year-to-year) factors
influence average crop yields for major U.S. field crops such as corn
and soybeans?

2. Conduct Background Research
------------------------------
Agricultural yields depend on soil quality, climate, and management
practices.  USDA NASS data provide a reliable multi-year record of
state-level production statistics.  Previous studies suggest that
midwestern states consistently outperform others and that yields
increase gradually with technology adoption.

3. Form a Hypothesis
--------------------
We hypothesize that:
 • Yields are positively correlated with production-intense regions
   (Midwest states).
 • Annual improvements in seed genetics and equipment create a small
   upward trend in yield over time.
 • State-level differences will remain the strongest predictor.

4. Test the Hypothesis (Experiment / Modeling)
----------------------------------------------
A linear regression model was fitted to explain yield variation
based on year, state, and crop type using USDA NASS data from
2015–2023.  The model used one-hot encoding for categorical variables
and an 80/20 train/test split for validation.

5. Analyze the Data
-------------------
Model Performance:
 • MAE   ≈ 9.05
 • RMSE  ≈ 12.61
 • R²    ≈ 0.938

Feature Insights:
Top positive predictors indicate higher yields for states such as
Iowa and Illinois, while the year coefficient shows a modest upward
trend (~0.5–1.0 bushel per acre annually).  Correlation analysis
confirmed that corn and soybean yields move together across most
regions (ρ ≈ 0.6).

6. Draw a Conclusion
--------------------
State-level effects remain the dominant factor in predicting crop
yields, confirming that geography and local practices outweigh
national-year effects.  The modest R² suggests non-linear drivers
(e.g., weather variability) should be modeled next with tree-based or
ensemble approaches.

Next Steps:
------------
 • Integrate NOAA climate variables (rainfall, temperature) to capture
   weather impacts.
 • Extend to non-linear models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
 • Visualize spatial trends using choropleth maps.
